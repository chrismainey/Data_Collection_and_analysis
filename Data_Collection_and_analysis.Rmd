# How do we generate data?

## Primary
+ We collect data about a thing:
 + Occurances of an event
 + Duration of something
 
## Secondary
+ We generate data as a by-product, or reuse it for another purpose:
 + Using patient care records to build risk models
 + Using patient data 
---
class: middle

# Question:

<br><br>
## Is the quality of care, in hospital X,  poor?

--

+ How would you answer this question?
+ Where / how could you access data for it?
+ What are the issues with this question, and potential answers?

---

# Types of information

Various theoretical frameworks for this, and we are not doing an in-depth study here.
Summarise into:

## Qualitative
+ Understanding the meaning, concepts, or how something is appears in the 'real world'

--

## Quantitative

+ Methods for discovering 'facts' 
+ Methods for dealing with 'hard' evidence, quantifiable usually in numbers

--

<br><br>
__Both involve measurement, interpretation, proxy effects etc.__

---

# Qualitative Data

<p2>...qualitative researchers study things in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them. Qualitative research involves the studied use and collection of a variety of empirical materials – case study, personal experience, introspective, life story, interview, observational, historical, interactional, and visual texts – that describe routine and problematic moments and meanings in individuals’ lives</p2><br>
___(Denzin & Lincoln, 2005)___

<br>


+ Interview, survey, feedback etc.
+ Observational: e.g. Ethnography

--

Examples:
+ Patient experience
+ Ethnographic study of behaviour in hospitals
+ Understanding what patients want from care

# Qualitative analysis

+ Understanding your phiolosophical position
  + Realism, Constructivism etc.
  
+ Identifying your data collection method
 + Sampling strategy
 
+ Record data, e.g. transcripts

+ Analysis methods
 + Formal, e.g. constant comparative methods
 + Will you 'code' and how will you do it?

<br> 
Example Tools:
+ Nvivo
+ MAXQDA
+ ATLAS.ti

# Quantitative analysis

---
## Data types

Data can take various forms:
E.g. measurements, grouping factors, estimates, observations etc.

+ Different in terms of:
 + Storage
 + Methods for summary/processing
 + Interpretation
--

+ A few major groups of data types:
 + Numeric
 + Binary
 + Categorical
  

---

## Data types (2)

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;"> Numeric </span>:
+ <span style="color:DodgerBlue ; font-weight:bold;"> Continuous:</span> values that can be constantly divided with a possible number in between
  + E.g. height of a person could be 172, 173 or 172.5 cm
  + <span style="color:SandyBrown; font-size:18px;"> Examples in HI: </span>  physiological measurements like blood pressure

--

<br><br>
+ <span style="color:DodgerBlue ; font-weight:bold;"> Discrete:</span> values that can only take whole numbers, usually obtained by counting.
  + E.g. Number of patients seen in a clinic could be 35 or 36 but not 35.5
  + <span style="color:SandyBrown; font-size:18px;"> Examples in HI: </span> counts of patients, waiting time measured in whole minutes, length of stay measured in days (like HED/HES), number of patient episodes

---

## Data types (3)

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;"> Binary </span>:
+ Exclusive two state variable 
  + E.g. 0/1, yes/no, TRUE/FALSE
  + <span style="color:SandyBrown; font-size:18px;"> Examples in HI: </span>  Patient dead or alive?, true or false answer to survey, patient status for a genetic marker

<span class="center" style="font-size:12px; line-height: 1.2em; font-style: italic;"> <i> Taken from: </i> xkcd https://xkcd.com/605/ </span>

---

## Data types (4)

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;"> Categorical </span>:
+ <span style="color:DodgerBlue ; font-weight:bold;"> Nominal:</span> Categories without any notion of order
  + E.g. Hair Colour, Brand of car, Country of residence
  + <span style="color:SandyBrown; font-size:18px;"> Examples in HI: </span>  Ethnicity, Admission method, Treatment speciality 

--

<br><br>
+ <span style="color:DodgerBlue ; font-weight:bold;"> Ordinal:</span> Categories with order, but not linear like numeric 
  + E.g. Survey answers ‘Good, OK & Bad’.  There is order, but ‘OK’ ≠ ‘Bad’ x 2 and ‘Good’ ≠ ‘Bad’ + ‘OK’
  + <span style="color:SandyBrown; font-size:18px;"> Examples in HI: </span> Cancer stage, self-assessed patient answers like ‘is your health poor, OK or good,’  Age-groups <1, 1-16, 17-40 etc.

# Mixed Methods? 

Certain questions might best be answered by a mixture of methods.


E.g. Evaluating a patient safety programme:
+ Interviews with managers and healthcare staff
+ Ethnographic observations on wards
+ Casenote review for adverse events
+ Patient outcomes: adverse events, mortality
+ Patient statisfaction

# Methods and considerations for quantitative data 

How can we go about answering a question?

---

# Example, summarising data
<br><br>
___“Dear informatics, I would like age of all patients admitted as an emergency to general medicine in December?”___

<br><br>

```{r ages, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ages<-c(75,81,59,70,64,67,66,54,68,72,80,66,70,76,75,52,59,52,86,56,51,59,72,61,53,72,75,69,64,55,74,54,61,74,86,53,68,69,76,58,59,79,59,69,91,55,59,68,58,70,68,60,89,54,85,76,56,56,84,91,90,87,90,85,54,76,91,79,53,62,72,69,75,76,76,76,63,85,76,85,67,63,91,63,64,69,63,60,57,83,69,60,58,70,59,85,68,85,56,79,85,76,76,73,60,87,57,67,72,92,58,55,54,71,90,55,58, 59,63,77,85,77,53,66,73,53,79,70,70,77,56,65,85,64,74,66,74,59,68,79,66,56,68,63,66,66,68,70,64,72,56,83,53,69,67,77,68,63,73,57,86,52,75,78,76,61,71,77,64,62,77,69,69,66,85,65,61,72,69,73,53,77,54,56,72,70,69,67,62,78,58,54,69,76,86,59,80,84,56,78,75,57,68,91,91)

## How would you answer that question

- What is the question?
- Sending a list of numbers doesn’t answer the question
- How might we show this in a better way?
- Summary figures?



<br>
### Visualise:
- Scatter plots
- Histogram or Kernel Density (sounds more impressive than it is)
- Box plot


---

# Scatter plots  

.pull-left[
Plots and 'x' variable by a 'y' variable by point

### Why doesn't this help?

- We've only got one variable, not two
- No summary information
- We want to see some kind of distribution 

]

.pull-right[
```{r scatter, include=TRUE, fig.retina=2, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align = "center", dependson=ages}
plot(ages)

```

]


---

## Histograms and Bar Charts

.pull-left[
- Plot of binned counts

- Good way to visualise distribution

- Bin sizes can vary & do not have to be equal

- Bar charts are related, but do not share the ‘binning’ idea. Can be used with categorical
]

.pull-right[
```{r hist1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height=5, fig.retina=2, fig.width=5, dependson=ages}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(as.data.frame(ages), aes(x=ages)) +
  geom_histogram(col="#F8766D", 
                 fill="#F8766D", alpha=0.5, binwidth = 1)+
  labs(title='Histogram of Ages, single-year bins')

```
]

---

### Histograms and Bar Charts (2) 
<br>

```{r hist2, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.align = "centre", dependson=ages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.pos="b"}
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(

  ggplot(as.data.frame(ages), aes(x=ages)) +
  geom_histogram( col="#F8766D", fill="#F8766D", alpha=0.5, binwidth = 2)+
  labs(title='Histogram of Ages, two-year bins')
,
ggplot(as.data.frame(ages), aes(x=ages)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), col="#F8766D", fill="#F8766D", alpha=0.5, breaks =c(50, 55,60,65,70,75,80,95) )+
  labs(title='Histogram of Ages, variable bins')
, 

ncol=2)

```


---

## Kernel Density

.pull-left[
```{r kernel, echo=FALSE, fig.align="centre", fig.height=5, fig.retina=2, fig.width=5, dependson=ages}
ggplot(as.data.frame(ages), aes(x=ages)) +
  geom_density( col="yellowgreen", 
                fill="yellowgreen", alpha=0.5)+
  labs(title='Density of Ages')

```
]

.pull-right[
<br>
- Similar to a smoothed histogram

- Plots the probability density of data rather than counts values

- Conceptually harder, but nicer visualisation
]

---

## Box Plots

.pull-left[
<br>
__Box range is (“hinges”):__

+ 25th percentile
+ 75th percentile
+ Line is the median (50th percentile)
+ Whiskers extend hinge ± 1.5 * IQR
+ Outliers (further points) are represented
+ Terms will be explained in the following slides

]

.pull-right[

```{r box, echo=FALSE, fig.align="centre", fig.height=6, fig.retina=2, fig.width=5, dependson=ages}
ggplot(as.data.frame(ages), 
       aes(y=ages, x="ages", group ="ages"))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title='Box Plot of Ages')

```

# Question:

### How can we describe the same data in words or numbers?


---

# Centre point

Few ways to describe this:
+ Mean - sum / count
+ Median - Middle value or ordered data
+ Mode - The most common value


```{r skew1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6.5, fig.retina=2, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

library(sn)
skew<-data.frame(
  index=seq(10000),
  l=round(as.numeric(rsn(10000, xi=0, omega=100, alpha=200)),0)
)

#didn't know how to do skewed distribution easily, so fudged it with this.  Using skewed normal distribution then correction for <0,
#by adding the minimum value (made positive) to all.  Then generate right skew version by reversing (max - value)
skew$l<-skew$l + abs(min(skew$l))
skew$r<-max(skew$l) - skew$l

#rearrange data into long "tidy" format for plotting. This uses the 'tidyr' function form the 'tidyverse.'
#Tidyverse is a modern set of R functions for doing most common things like data manipluation, plotting etc. Easier than base R.
#This function will give and index column, a key column that will contain l, or r, and a value.
library(tidyr)
skew_t<-gather(skew, key, value, -index)
skew_t$key<-as.factor(skew_t$key)
levels(skew_t$key) <- c("Left skew", "Right skew")


#ggplot, using 'facet' to split into two plots according to 'key'
s<-ggplot(skew_t, aes(x=value,col=key, fill=key))+
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.5)+
  facet_grid(~key)

s
```


```{r skew2, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,  fig.width=9, fig.height=7, fig.align="center"}

###Add summary statistics.  R doesn't have a 'mode' function so here's a used defined one:
getmode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]

}


#Add pre-calculated lines for mean, median and mode.
s<-s+geom_vline(aes(xintercept = value, col="mean"), size=1, linetype=2, data=data.frame(key=rbind("Left skew", "Right skew"),value=rbind(l=mean(skew$l),r=mean(skew$r))))+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = value, col="median"), size=1, linetype=2,data=data.frame(key=rbind("Left skew", "Right skew"),value=rbind(l=median(skew$l),r=median(skew$r))))+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = value, col="mode"), size=1, linetype=2, data=data.frame(key=rbind("Left skew", "Right skew"),value=rbind(l=getmode(skew$l),r=getmode(skew$r))))+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("mean" = "2", "median" = "3","mode" ="4"), limits=c("mean","median","mode"))+
  guides(fill=FALSE)

  
s
```

## Summarising Skewed Data (2)

```{r skew3, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,  fig.width=9, fig.height=7, fig.align="center"}
qtiles<-
  skew_t %>% 
  filter(key=="Left skew") %>% 
  summarise(p25=quantile(value, probs=0.25),
            median=quantile(value, probs=0.5),
            p75=quantile(value, probs=0.75)) %>% 
  gather()

#ggplot, using 'facet' to split into two plots according to 'key'
s_qtl<-ggplot(skew_t[skew_t$key=="Left skew",], aes(x=value))+
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.5, bins=50,  colour="#F8766D",  fill="#F8766D")+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=value, group=key, col=key), data=qtiles, size =1)
